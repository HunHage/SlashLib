# SlashLib: A Slash Command Framework for [Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J)
A fully customizable yet simple framework that handles slash command creation, updates, and deletion based on how your commands are configured within your code. Additionally, a context helper is included to gather common data needed by commands such as Guild, User, Channel, or GuildChannel.

# Licence
This project is under the MIT licence. While not a requirement I do ask that if your bot uses this library, and the source code is public (such as hosted on GitHub/GitLab/Gitea), that you make mention of this library in the description or readme to help those trying to make their own bot.
